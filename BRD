Project Title: Integrated Data Aggregator with Notifications
________________________________________
1. Project Overview
This project is a multi-threaded Java Spring Boot application designed to provide real-time updates and aggregated data in various domains, including weather, commodities, news, blogs, stocks, cricket scores, and music recommendations. It also incorporates a notification system to deliver timely and relevant alerts to the user.

2. Objectives
1.	Deliver personalized, aggregated information across various domains in one application.
2.	Provide modular and scalable architecture for adding future sub-modules.
3.	Notify users of critical, time-sensitive, and relevant updates.
